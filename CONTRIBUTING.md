# Contributing to Claude Code Writing System

We welcome contributions that improve the writing quality and research capabilities of this template! This project helps content creators build personalized AI writing systems, and your expertise can make it work better for everyone.

## üéØ Current Priority Areas

We're currently focused on improvements in these key areas:

### 1. **Agent Prompt Improvements**
- LinkedIn agent optimization (hooks, engagement, professional tone)
- Newsletter agent refinement (subject lines, personal voice, structure)
- Conversational agent enhancement (social media posts, podcast Q&A scripts)

### 2. **Research & Writing Workflow**
- Improving the `/research` command effectiveness
- Enhancing the `/write` command output quality
- Suggesting high-quality default research sources
- Streamlining the research-to-publication pipeline

## üìã Contribution Requirements

### Before You Submit
All contributions must include:

1. **Before/After Comparison**: Test your changes against real content
2. **Output Examples**: Show actual generated content with your improvements
3. **Brief Explanation**: 2-3 sentences on why the "after" version is better
4. **Testing Evidence**: Demonstrate the improvement works consistently

### Example Contribution Format
```
## Improvement: LinkedIn Agent Hook Generation

**Before**: Generic opening lines that don't engage
**After**: Compelling hooks that drive comments and shares

**Test Results**:
- Original prompt generated: "Here's an interesting trend in remote work..."
- Improved prompt generated: "Most productivity advice for remote workers is still stuck in 2019."

**Why Better**: The improved version uses a contrarian hook that immediately challenges assumptions, leading to higher engagement rates.
```
